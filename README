This is a simple script to find the pattern lock code on an Android Device.

It works by opening a gesture.key file supplied using the -f flag or a raw text hash provided by the -r flag which is compared to a rainbow table of all patterns.

You do not need to download the rainbow table on its own, simply download the entire repo and run the script.


USAGE

python gesturecrack.py -f /path/to/gesture.key
(usually the file is in android/data/system/gesture.key)

python gesturecrack.py -r 8e7e00c0bd5ce227f7be204c8b7c159669c776d4


FORKED

Now the script is running on python3
